1
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,250
All the food was delicious.

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,960
Thanks for inviting me, Yoshida-kun.

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,490
Um, Gotou-san...

4
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,350
Would you like to come
to my place after this?

5
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,520
I'm sorry. I don't mention it at work,

6
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,510
but I'm seeing someone.

7
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,320
And so, my unrequited love came to an end.

8
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,070
If you've got a man, then just say so!

9
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,920
"The Teenage Girl Beneath the Lamplight"

10
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,550
Hey, Yoshida, you're being too loud!

11
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,630
Sorry, he's a little drunk.

12
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,210
Cut it out.

13
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,940
You dumbass! I'm not done being mad yet!

14
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,450
I was wondering why you wanted
to talk so suddenly.

15
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,560
Liver
200 Yen

16
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,560
Heart
200 Yen

17
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,560
Rump
200 Yen

18
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,180
You just wanted to bitch
about being rejected.

19
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,320
Damn it! She said she'd been
seeing the guy for five years!

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,760
She tricked me!

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,340
She stole my heart and won't give it back!

22
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,680
Gimme another glass of beer!

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,200
You're drinking too much.

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,920
It's fine. We're off tomorrow!

25
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,360
I'm heading home before the trains shut down.

26
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,750
My wife's waiting for me.

27
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,210
Fine!

28
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,340
Damn it all. Gotou...

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,160
Hey, you. Teenage girl.

30
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,700
What are you doing out at this hour?

31
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,420
Go home.

32
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,390
There aren't any trains running.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,970
So are you gonna sit there all night?

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,720
That sounds like it'd be pretty cold.

35
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,430
So what will you do?

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,860
Let me stay at your place, Mister.

37
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,080
"Mister"—

38
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,980
Listen. What kind of teenage girl wants
to stay at the place of a man she's never met?

39
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,580
But I don't have anywhere to go tonight.

40
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,750
If you head back to the station, you
can sleep at a karaoke place or internet café.

41
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,040
I don't have any money.

42
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,820
So I'm supposed to let you stay for free?

43
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,830
Well...

44
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,980
I'll let you do me, so let me stay.

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,370
Are all teenage girls like this now?

46
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,720
No, that's definitely not true.

47
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,440
She's just weird!

48
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,620
Don't say that, even as a joke.

49
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,120
It's not a joke. I'm fine with it.

50
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,310
Well, I'm not.

51
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,660
I'm not sleeping with a little kid.

52
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,660
Okay...

53
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,870
Then let me stay for free!

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,500
Hello!

55
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,660
It's filthy.

56
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,090
Why would a man living in a
one-room apartment keep it clean?

57
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,050
I've seen some that were clean.

58
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,470
What?

59
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,070
Uh, nothing...

60
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,200
Don't get involved.

61
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,190
No matter what kind of life she's lived,
no matter where she was before she came here...

62
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,050
It's not your problem!

63
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,430
I'll kick her out in the morning,
and then it'll be over.

64
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,650
You're going to sleep?

65
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,500
You do what you want.

66
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,480
Hey, are you sure you don't want to do me?

67
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,640
Don't make me repeat myself.

68
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,880
I'm not into little kids.

69
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,510
You're not.

70
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,770
Anything else you want me to do, then?

71
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,150
Miso soup.

72
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,350
Miso soup... made by a woman...

73
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,410
That's what I want.

74
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,730
Oh, shit! I'm late.

75
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,400
It's Sunday.

76
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,150
What's this smell?

77
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,040
Oh, you're finally awake.

78
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,860
Good morning.

79
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,130
What the hell are you?

80
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,200
I'm not sure how to answer that.
"A teenage girl"?

81
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,400
What's a teenage girl doing in my house?

82
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,540
I asked you to let me stay here,
and you said it was okay.

83
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,080
Who said it was okay?

84
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,040
You did!

85
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,240
I did not!

86
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,530
You definitely did, Mister.

87
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,070
Um... well.

88
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,260
I didn't assault you or anything, right?

89
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,740
Just kidding!

90
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,810
I just wanted to tease you a little.

91
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,200
You...

92
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,700
You kept saying you didn't want
to sleep with a little girl.

93
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,910
Whew! Good work, last-night me!

94
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,180
So I asked if there was anything else
you wanted me to do, and...

95
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,210
Miso soup?

96
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,600
I made it.

97
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Don't make miso soup
in other people's houses.

98
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,930
What's that sigh?

99
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,960
You told me to make it, Mister.

100
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,750
Stop calling me that.

101
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,600
So what would you like me to call you, then?

102
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,110
I don't care what you call me. Just leave.

103
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,640
You really don't remember anything?

104
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,320
I was sitting under a lamp post last night,
and you came up and talked to me.

105
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,510
Last night? Lamp post?

106
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,690
You remember?

107
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,100
Black panties.

108
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,160
What kind of answer is that?

109
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,760
That's awful.

110
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,360
I see.

111
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,280
Mister, listen...

112
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,640
I said...

113
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,180
What's your name?

114
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,100
Yoshida.

115
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,540
Yoshida-san.

116
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,520
That fits. You look like a Yoshida-san.

117
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,840
What does that mean?

118
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,820
Anyway, have some miso soup.

119
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,070
We can talk then.

120
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,780
Why are you telling me what to do?

121
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,210
Eat up before it gets cold.

122
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,750
It's good.

123
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,550
You wanted Gotou-san to make it for you,
didn't you?

124
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,640
How did you know?

125
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,020
You got rejected last night, right?
You were mumbling about it in your sleep.

126
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,650
Hey...

127
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,610
Want me to make you feel better?

128
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,290
I keep telling you to stop that.

129
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,670
You're not fooling anyone.

130
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:49,780
Listen, I'm not so far gone that I need
a tiny little teenage girl to make me feel better.

131
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,470
I think my boobs are pretty big.

132
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,670
Well, they might be big for a teenager.

133
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,180
But Gotou-san's are bigger.

134
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,890
They are, huh?

135
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,150
What cup size?

136
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,060
I don't know, but probably F!

137
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,170
F is the same size as me.

138
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,270
Huh?! Those are F?

139
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,110
Yeah.

140
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,080
If they look bigger than these,
they're probably a G or H.

141
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,430
H-cup...

142
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,220
I see.

143
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,570
H-cup.

144
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,840
I wish I could've stuck it between
those H-cups, just once.

145
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:37,420
But aren't F-cups you can touch
worth more than H-cups you can't?

146
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,770
Listen. Why are you trying
so hard to seduce me?

147
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,890
What if I really did it?

148
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,470
Well, then we'd do it.

149
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,380
You want to do it with me?

150
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,920
No, not really.

151
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,950
What is your problem?

152
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,660
Plenty of men would do it!

153
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,050
Then let me ask you...

154
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:03,980
What?

155
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,840
There's a girl in front of you
who's willing to do it. Why won't you?

156
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,090
Why are you making that face?

157
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,090
You're the one who's not normal, Yoshida-san.

158
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:25,350
I've never met a man who was willing
to let me stay for nothing in return.

159
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,780
Are you stupid?

160
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,400
What's your name?

161
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,410
Sayu.

162
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,200
Where are you from? Show me your student ID.

163
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,790
Asahikawa High School 6

164
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,300
Asahikawa?!

165
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,950
You came all the way from Hokkaido alone?

166
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,790
Yeah.

167
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,560
When did you leave Hokkaido?

168
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,520
Six months ago, I think.

169
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,890
Did you tell your parents?

170
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,080
No...

171
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,600
Then get your ass back home.

172
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
I'm fine.

173
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,850
I'm sure they're happy I'm gone.

174
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,080
What the hell?

175
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,540
You sure don't look fine to me.

176
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,950
You don't know that.

177
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,410
I do.

178
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,350
If you don't want to go home,
or go to school,

179
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,060
how are you going to survive?

180
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,750
I'll work out a way to stay
at somebody's house.

181
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,670
And how will you "work out a way"?

182
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,800
Don't insult me.

183
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,040
I don't know how any other guys felt,

184
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,640
but I don't have the slightest
interest in your body.

185
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,760
What will you do if I kick you out?

186
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,350
I-I'll find another place to stay, somehow.

187
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,230
How, specifically?

188
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,470
Well...

189
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,860
Why don't you get it?

190
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,660
Work.

191
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:15,030
All the other kids who drop
out of school make money to live.

192
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,450
But I can't pay rent
with just a part-time job.

193
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,380
Then live here.

194
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,630
But...

195
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
No money. No place to live.

196
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,190
So you'll just go around seducing guys?

197
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,600
I'm going to knock the stupid
right out of you.

198
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,440
You keep calling me stupid.

199
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,380
Well, 'cause you're stupid!
You're as dumb as a rock.

200
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,450
You're a spoiled little brat
who doesn't know what things are worth.

201
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,580
Why?

202
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,960
Why couldn't she have a normal life

203
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,720
and a normal love?

204
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,350
First, you're doing all the chores here.
That's your job.

205
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,130
Listen. Right now we need
to work out our living space.

206
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,470
I don't want you making a mess of things.

207
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,690
You're making it sound like
I can stay here forever.

208
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,530
Not forever.

209
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,940
When you're done being a runaway,
get your ass back home.

210
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,650
But I can stay here until then?

211
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:29,040
It would've been hard, but there were other,
healthier ways to make a living

212
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,370
than trying to seduce men
into letting her stay.

213
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,140
But for some reason,
she forgot that a long time ago.

214
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,120
And over the past few minutes it's
clear that she's totally spoiled.

215
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,660
If I don't watch my mouth,
she may end up staying here for years.

216
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,060
You can stay here until you learn
to stop being a spoiled brat.

217
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:59,870
But the next time you try to seduce me,
I'm kicking you out!

218
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,520
O-Okay!

219
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,450
And thus began a strange chapter

220
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,740
in the lives of a runaway girl
and a 26-year-old salaryman.

221
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,700
But in that moment,

222
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:19,660
I didn't realize how hard it is
to live with a teenage girl.

223
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,750
Is that what happened after that?!

224
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,310
Keep your voice down!

225
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,310
Listen, that's not good.

226
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,260
Is there a missing-persons report out on her?

227
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:37,020
I looked online and didn't see a thing.

228
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,080
But you can't just take in a runaway teen
without knowing what her deal is.

229
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,480
Yeah, it's pretty risky, actually.

230
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,280
Did she eat?

231
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,200
Well, just don't get too attached.

232
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,170
You should send her back to her parents
before it becomes a problem.

233
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,630
I know that, but...

234
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,260
I'm sure they're happy I'm gone.

235
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,980
She's still just a teen.
She shouldn't be making a face like that.

236
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,060
Miso soup?

237
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,320
Welcome back, Daddy!

238
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,520
Stop it. That's gross.

239
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,910
But I've only made miso soup so far.

240
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,500
I bought us bento. You'll eat one, too, right?

241
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,630
She ironed them?

242
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,610
She's better at chores than I thought.

243
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,090
Thank you for the meal.

244
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,200
What's wrong, Yoshida-san?

245
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,630
Nothing.

246
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,920
Anyway, where's the ashtray?

247
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,820
Sorry, I washed it
with the rest of the dishes.

248
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,930
I see. Thanks.

249
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,880
What?

250
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,940
Why are you going out to the patio?
You can smoke here.

251
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,000
Because you're here.

252
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,740
You're nice.

253
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,160
Nice?

254
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,860
It's just... All the other guys smoked
without worrying about me.

255
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:47,940
Why is she getting all her
values from loser guys?

256
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,990
Sayu!

257
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,580
Listen up! I'm not nice. They were shit.

258
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,710
Get that straight.

259
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,130
Have standards for yourself.
And for everything else.

260
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,830
Okay.

261
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:13,050
I keep looking at her as if I'm her guardian.

262
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,390
I don't know how anybody
could get hard looking at that.

263
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,740
Part of what made her such a mess
is that she's spoiled.

264
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:34,730
But I'm sure there were grown-ups
and an environment that made it worse.

265
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,950
The whole world's full of shitheads.

266
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,620
Everybody.

267
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,240
Including me. I'm letting her stay spoiled.
Giving her a place to run to.

268
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,580
And what do I even want to do?

269
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,590
Alarm

270
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,640
Sorry, I left my alarm on,
even though it's my day off.

271
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,360
It's okay.

272
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:09,000
I was going to get up
and do the laundry early anyway.

273
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,320
Ow...

274
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,700
Metropolitan Police arrested a man in Musashino for abduction
of a minor on suspicion of kidnapping a 17-year old girl.

275
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,180
'Scuse me!

276
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,680
I just saw your panties.

277
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,080
It's a skirt. I can't help it!

278
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,330
You've been wearing your uniform
this whole time, haven't you?

279
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,120
It's all I have.

280
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,050
And I wash it, so it's not dirty.

281
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:40,090
It's weird to have you
wearing a uniform here, though.

282
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,430
It's fine. Let's go home, Yoshida-san.

283
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,700
You're not fine. Just get some new clothes.

284
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,390
All you've got is this uniform, right?

285
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,070
So you're buying clothes.

286
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,180
And I'm buying a new futon.

287
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,610
You wake up rubbing your back
and saying "ow" every morning.

288
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,320
I was doing that?

289
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,690
You sure were.

290
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,620
But...

291
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,870
But...

292
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,340
If you do all that for me,
I won't know how to repay you.

293
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,810
So that's it?

294
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:25,850
She's not trying to be modest.
She can't take it, because she can't repay me.

295
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,870
Why does a kid think like that?

296
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,310
I'm pretty busy.

297
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,150
So I can't spend time on chores.

298
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,030
But you're doing it all, right?

299
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,490
This past week or so,
it's been a lot easier for me at home.

300
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,950
Is that not enough?

301
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,670
If you're okay with it, then I am.

302
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,120
Okay, that's how it is, then.

303
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,090
It's so comfy!

304
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,430
It's better to have a futon, right?

305
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,890
Yeah! I'll sleep great tonight.

306
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,390
Yoshida-san.

307
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,270
Want to sleep with me?

308
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,460
Hey! I told you if you tried
to seduce me again, I'd kick you out!

309
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,740
I didn't say a word
about doing anything dirty.

310
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,110
You're such a perv.

311
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,480
Hey...

312
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,380
You're cuter when you laugh.

313
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,340
Wh-Why are you hitting on me?

314
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,450
I told you. You're not my type.

315
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,500
Yoshida-san...

316
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,140
Thanks.

317
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,860
There's a rumor going around
that you got a girlfriend.

318
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,820
What the hell?

319
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,620
You're going home
right at quitting time every day.

320
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,420
You're cleaner. Your shirts are ironed.

321
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,590
Your face has more color to it,
and you're doing a better job at work, they say.

322
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,000
The girls were saying that.

323
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,220
What the hell?

324
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,430
It's actually a teenage girl, though.

325
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,050
Yeah, I guess.

326
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,760
A runaway girl sounds like somebody
who's kind of ditzy.

327
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,900
But maybe she has her act together.

328
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,190
Yeah, that's true.

329
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,640
Yeah, she's not my type, physically.

330
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,280
But she's pretty cute.

331
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,040
She can do chores and she's friendly.

332
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,540
So why run away?

333
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,730
And come all the way to Tokyo?

334
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,910
Yoshida-san, your facial hair.

335
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,090
Don't you want to shave it?

336
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,300
Not today. I'm too lazy.

337
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,610
Some days you shave,
and sometimes you don't.

338
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,760
Is there a reason?

339
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,440
Nope. I just shave it
when it gets long.

340
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,630
And you don't think that's long?

341
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,470
Maybe I will shave it.

342
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,660
Which is it?

343
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,790
Well, it makes me feel old.

344
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,660
Why?

345
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:45,130
When I just turned twenty, I would shave it
any time it got even the slightest bit long.

346
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,250
And I'd try really hard
not to miss any spots.

347
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,500
Having facial hair is kind
of a symbol of being old.

348
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,640
But I think that's wrong.

349
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,140
Wrong?

350
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,820
When you get too lazy to shave
your facial hair is when you're old.

351
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,020
Yoshida-san.

352
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,790
That facial hair doesn't
look that good on you.

353
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,910
Nobody asked you.

354
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,360
Yoshida-san, you'll be late.

355
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,900
I know!

356
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,640
I guess I will shave it.

357
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:35,050
Next time

358
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:35,050
"Cell Phone"

359
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:40,060
See you next week!
